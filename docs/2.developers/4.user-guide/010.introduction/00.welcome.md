# Welcome to Pathway Developer Documentation!

Pathway is a Python data processing framework for analytics and AI pipelines over data streams.
Itâ€™s the ideal solution for real-time processing use cases like streaming ETL or RAG pipelines for unstructured data.

Pathway comes with an **easy-to-use Python API**, allowing you to seamlessly integrate your favorite Python ML libraries.
Pathway syntax is simple and intuitive, and **you can use the same code for both batch and streaming processing**.

Pathway is powered by a **scalable Rust engine** based on Differential Dataflow and performing incremental computation.
Your Pathway code, despite being written in Python, is run by the engine, enabling multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed computations.
All the pipeline is kept in memory and can be easily deployed with **Docker and Kubernetes**.

You can install Pathway with a simple pip command:
::pip-install
