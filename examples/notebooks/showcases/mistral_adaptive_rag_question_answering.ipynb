        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer questions based on knowledge not present in the original training set. At [Pathway](https://pathway.com/) we use RAG to build [document intelligence solutions](/solutions/rag-pipelines) that answer questions based on private document collections, such as a repository of legal contracts. We are constantly working on improving the accuracy and explainability of our models while keeping the costs low. In this blog post, we share a trick that helped us reach those goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "A typical RAG Question Answering procedure works in two steps. First, the question is analyzed and a number of relevant documents are retrieved from a database, typically using a similarity search inside a vector space created by a neural embedding model. Second, retrieved documents are pasted, along with the original question, into a prompt which is sent to the LLM. Thus, the LLM answers the question within a relevant context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Practical implementations of the RAG procedure need to specify the number of documents put into the prompt. A large number of documents increases the ability of the LLM to provide a correct answer but also increases LLM costs, which typically grow linearly with the length of the provided prompt. The prompt size also influences model explainability: retrieved context documents explain and justify the answer of the LLM and the fewer context documents are needed, the easier it is to verify and trust model outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus the context size, given by the number of considered documents in a RAG setup, must be chosen to balance costs, desired answer quality, and explainability. However, can we do better than using the same context size regardless of the question to be answered? Intuitively, not all questions are equally hard and some can be answered using a small number of supporting documents, while some may require the LLM to consult a larger prompt. We can confirm this by running a question-answering experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Adaptive RAG\n",
        "We can use the model\u2019s refusal to answer questions as a form of model introspection which enables an adaptive RAG question-answering strategy:\n",
        "\n",
        "::card\n",
        "#title\n",
        "Adaptive Rag Idea\n",
        "#description\n",
        "Ask the LLM with a small number of context documents. If it refuses to answer, repeat the question with a larger prompt.\n",
        "::\n",
        "\n",
        "This RAG scheme adapts to the hardness of the question and the quality of the retrieved supporting documents using the feedback from the LLM - for most documents a single LLM call with a small prompt is sufficient, and there is no need for an auxiliary LLM calls to e.g. guess an initial supporting document count for a question. However, a fraction of questions will require re-asking or rere-asking the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve it, we can use a geometric series to expand the prompt with retrieved documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "To learn more about how we do it, and the observed benefits, please see the original work [here.](https://pathway.com/developers/showcases/adaptive-rag)\n",

        "\n",
        "Most of the RAG applications require you to send your documents & data to propriety APIs. This is a concern for most organizations as data privacy with sensitive documents becomes an issue. Generally, you need to send your documents during the indexing and LLM question-answering stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "To tackle this, you can use locally deployed LLMs and embedders in your RAG pipeline. We eliminate the need to go to proprietary APIs with the help of Ollama, HuggingFace and Pathway.\n",
        "Everything is staying local on your machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why use local LLMs?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several reasons why you may want to use local or open-source LLMs over propriety ones.\n",
        "- Building RAG applications require documents to be sent to the LLM, this may be an issue in some organizations with sensitive data.\n",
        "- We have observed that some LLMs that are served over the API are regressing in terms of accuracy, with local models, this won't be an issue.\n",
        "- It is possible to fine-tune local LLMs to behave in certain ways or achieve domain adaptation."

To achieve this, we had to make some modifications to the original prompts, and the LLM inference parameters.\n",
