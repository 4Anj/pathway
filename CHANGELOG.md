# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2023-11-10

### Added
- A flag `with_metadata` for the filesystem-based connectors to attach the source file metadata to the table entries.
- Methods `pw.debug.table_from_list_of_batches` and `pw.debug.table_from_list_of_batches_by_workers` for creating tables with defined data being inserted over time.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `pw.debug.table_from_pandas` and `pw.debug.table_from_markdown` now will create tables in the streaming mode, instead of static, if given table definition contains `_time` column.
- **BREAKING**: Renamed the parameter `keep_queries` in `pw.io.http.rest_connector` to `delete_queries` with the opposite meaning. It changes the default behavior - it was `keep_queries=False`, now it is `delete_queries=False`.

## [0.5.3] - 2023-10-27

### Added
- A method `get_nearest_items_asof_now` in `KNNIndex` that allows to get nearest neighbors without updating old queries in the future.
- A method `asof_now_join` in `Table` to join rows from left side of the join with right side of the join at their processing time. Past rows from left side are not used when new data appears on the right side.

## [0.5.2] - 2023-10-19

### Added
- `interval_join` now supports forgetting old entries. The configuration can be passed using `behavior` parameter of `interval_join` method.
- Decorator `@table_transformer` for marking that functions take Tables as arguments.
- Namespace for all columns `Table.C.*`.
- Output connectors now provide logs about the number of entries written and time taken.
- Filesystem connectors now support reading whole files as rows.
- Command line option for `pathway spawn` to record data and `pathway replay` command to replay data.

## [0.5.1] - 2023-10-04

### Fixed
- `select` operates only on consistent states.

## [0.5.0] - 2023-10-04

### Added
- `Schema` method `typehints` that returns dict of mypy-compatible typehints.
- Support for JSON parsing from CSV sources.
- `restrict` method in `Table` to restrict table universe to the universe of the other table.
- Better support for postgresql types in the output connector.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: renamed `Table` method `dtypes` to `typehints`. It now returns a `dict` of mypy-compatible typehints.
- **BREAKING**: `Schema.__getitem__` returns a data class `ColumnSchema` containing all related information on particular column.
- **BREAKING**: `tuple` reducer used after intervals_over window now sorts values by time.
- **BREAKING**: expressions used in `select`, `filter`, `flatten`, `with_columns`, `with_id`, `with_id_from` have to have the same universe as the table. Earlier it was possible to use an expression from a superset of a table universe. To use expressions from wider universes, one can use `restrict` on the expression source table.
- **BREAKING**: `pw.universes.promise_are_equal(t1, t2)` no longer allows to use references from `t1` and `t2` in a single expression. To change the universe of a table, use `with_universe_of`.
- **BREAKING**: `ix` and `ix_ref` are temporarily broken inside joins (both temporal and ordinary).
- `select`, `filter`, `concat` keep columns as a single stream. The work for other operators is ongoing.

### Fixed
- Optional types other than string correctly output to PostgreSQL.

## [0.4.1] - 2023-09-25

### Added
- Support for messages compressed with zstd in the Kafka connector.

## [0.4.0] - 2023-09-21

### Added
- Support for JSON data format, including `pw.Json` type.
- Methods `as_int()`, `as_float()`, `as_str()`, `as_bool()` to convert values from `Json`.
- New argument `skip_nones` for `tuple` and `sorted_tuple` reducers.
- New argument `is_outer` for `intervals_over` window.
- `pw.schema_from_dict` and `pw.schema_from_csv` for generating schema based, respectively, on provided definition as a dictionary and CSV file with sample data.
- `generate_class` method in `Schema` class for generating schema class code.

### Changed
- Method `get()` and `[]` to support accessing elements in Jsons.
- Function `pw.assert_table_has_schema` for writing asserts checking, whether given table has the same schema as the one that is given as an argument.
- **BREAKING**: `ix` and `ix_ref` operations are now standalone transformations of `pw.Table` into `pw.Table`. Most of the usages remain the same, but sometimes user needs to provide a context (when e.g. using them inside `join` or `groupby` operations). `ix` and `ix_ref` are temporarily broken inside temporal joins.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where new-style optional types (e.g. `int | None`) were translated to `Any` dtype.

## [0.3.4] - 2023-09-18

### Fixed
- Incompatible `beartype` version is now excluded from dependencies.

## [0.3.3] - 2023-09-14

### Added
- Module `pathway.dt` to construct and manipulate DTypes.
- New argument `keep_queries` in `pw.io.http.rest_connector`.

### Changed
- Internal representation of DTypes. Inputting types is compatible backwards.
- Temporal functions now accept arguments of mixed types (ints and floats). For example, `pw.temporal.interval` can use ints while columns it interacts with are floats.
- Single-element arrays are now treated as arrays, not as scalars.

### Fixed
- `to_string()` method on datetimes always prints 9 fractional digits.
- `%f` format code in `strptime()` parses fractional part of a second correctly regardless of the number of digits.

## [0.3.2] - 2023-09-07

### Added

- `Table.cast_to_types()` function that can perform `pathway.cast` on multiple columns.
- `intervals_over` window, which allows to get temporally close data to given times.
- `demo.replay_csv_with_time` function that can replay a CSV file following the timestamps of a given column.

### Fixed

- Static data is now copied to ensure immutability.
- Improved error tracing mechanism to work with any type of error.

## [0.3.1] - 2023-08-29

### Added

- `tuple` reducer, that returns a tuple with values.
- `ndarray` reducer, that returns an array with values.

### Changed
- `numpy` arrays of `int32`, `uint32` and `float32` are now converted to their 64-bit variants instead of tuples.
- KNNIndex interface to take columns as inputs.
- Reducers now check types of their arguments.

### Fixed

- Fixed delayed reporting of output connector errors.
- Python objects are now freed more often, reducing peak memory usage.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-08-07

### Added

- `@` (matrix multiplication) operator.

### Changed

- Python version 3.10 or later is now required.
- Type checking is now more strict.

## [0.2.1] - 2023-07-31

### Changed

- Immediately forget queries in REST connector.
- Make type annotations mandatory in `Schema`.

### Fixed

- Fixed IDs coming from CSV source.
- Fixed indices of dataframes from pandas transformer.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-07-20

### Added
